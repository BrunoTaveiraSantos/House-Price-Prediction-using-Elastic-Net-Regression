# House-Price-Prediction-using-Elastic-Net-Regression

This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices using an Elastic Net regression model. The dataset used includes various features related to house characteristics to predict the sale price.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model Selection: Implementation of Elastic Net, which combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to handle multicollinearity and select important features.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized cross-validation to fine-tune the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio).

Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess the model's accuracy.

Getting Started:

Dependencies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

Running the Model: Clone the repo and run the Jupyter notebook provided to see the data preprocessing and model training in action.
